## Questions

1. Find out more about CORS -> Cross Origin Resource Sharing

- Who recieves the information ie (a) server or (b) client ?
- Does the useEffect hook run after everything, like an event loop ?
  - does it update the component after the component is rendered ?
  - Are we to just use useEffect all the time ?
